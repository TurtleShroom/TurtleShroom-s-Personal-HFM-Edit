atlantic_slave_trade_reinstate_desc;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ strength is now enough to challenge the Great Powers of Europe, and now they can do little to stop our right to trade with the African continent. They denied our right, but now we can overturn the laws that banished the slave trade, and allow our country to flourish like never before.

annex_haiti_desc;Not so long ago, the island of Haiti was a French slave state.

However, we will not let another flag fly on Texan soil, and just as our forefathers fought to keep this country free, so will we do our part.

tex_support_csa_desc;With America divided between the Northern Union and the Southern Confederates, we should cast our lot in this great Civil War. Since we have long had ties to the Southern states, perhaps we should ally with them, though considering that this will quickly draw our country to war, the Texan people may not look on this decision too fondly.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT180000DESC;Now that the war is over, the question arises whether or not we should allow the slaves we enlisted during the war to remain free, or send them back to work on the plantations. We made a promise to secure their freedom, but wars are a fickle thing, and some sacrifices have to be made for the betterment of the nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT181000DESC;With the dawn of the twentieth century, slavery in modern countries is fading away due to the prevalance of industry. A mere fifty years ago $COUNTRY_ADJ$ strength may have been founded on the backs of our slaves, but as tractors, automobiles, trains and other machines are making industry replace old mass labour, we have to make a distinct choice. Do we organize our slave economy, favouring it over industrial strength, or do we join the onward march of progress and free ourselves from the shackles that a slave society has forced us into? Just as fifty years ago a great house was divided, so now our $COUNTRY$ must become all one thing, or all the other: strong in the grip of slavery, or strong in the freedom of progress.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

We have no choice but to end our trade, and focus on slavery within the bounds of our own country and neighbouring nations - or, should we have the power, we can lead the slave trade in place of the fools who dismantled it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT186000DESC;Once we may have made slavery the centrepiece of our country, but those times have passed. The time of mass labour and the slave trade is over, and we now sever all our attachments to those detestable pieces of our history. Free at last! By gosh, we are free at last!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT186001TITLE;$COUNTRY$ Withdraws from Slave Trade!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT186001DESC;Our enactment of Freedom of Womb has ended all importation and expansion of the slave population in our nation. This means the slave population will plateau and future sons of slaves will be born free, but more importantly, it means we can no longer participate in the despicable trade the other slave powers are in on. Let us now focus on slavery within the bounds of our own country.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA186001;So be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC186501;Revolutionary change has begun in $COUNTRY$, and it will greatly effect our status as a slave state. We have enacted Freedom of Womb in our country. This means we have committed to ceasing new slave importation and any expansion of the slave population. Future sons of slaves will be freemen, but more importantly, it means we can no longer engage in the despicable importation of slaves. In accordance with the new lands of our nation, we must immediately end the Global Slave Trade.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT187620DESC;Legendary showman (and scam artist) P.T. Barnum opened his first three-ring circus in 1871, beginning a circus craze that would last well into the 20th century. His pioneering venture, the world-renowned Ringling Brothers Circus, would last nearly a hundred fifty years, finally closing in 2017. Of course, most of the excitement and the curios he displayed were all fake, but that was all part of the show - and the money.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT187630DESC;In order to improve the efficiency of railroads in our nation, we have adopted a system of standard time to prevent any confusion between train stations on the length of our railroad networks.

EVT187640DESC;Pioneered by men like Scott Joplin and Ernest Hogan, ragtime is a genre of music that began amongst African-Americans in the South. Afterwards, it became widely known and widely played on piano, and had a key role in popularizing new music recording methods and the later genre of jazz.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT187650DESC;Blues music, like ragtime and jazz before it, was first played and composed by Afro-American musicians of the American South. While jazz enjoyed popularity amongst blacks and whites in the 1920s and 1930s, blues was mostly relegated to black listeners until after the Second World War. It was arguably formed as a musical genre in 1912 with the publishing of Hart Wand's "Dallas Blues," but has its roots in traditional slave songs of the 19th century. Most famously, blues later became the bedrock for the most popular musical sensation of them all: rock n' roll.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT187660DESC;Though the North always was the industrial centre of America, in the Deep South there was the city of New Orleans, always full of sound and lights. The epitome of southern prosperity, New Orleans was a hub of trade and immigration, and at its peak was the third largest city in the entire United States.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT187670DESC;The city of New Orleans always has had an association with the festival of Mardi Gras, a Christian cultural celebration taking place prior to the season of Lent brought to the area by French Catholic colonists. Normally it is meant to be just a single day of celebrations, but in New Orleans the colourful and energetic Mardi Gras can last for several days more. Mardi Gras was recognized as an official state holiday of Louisiana in 1875.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT187680DESC;Politeness, etiquette, and the warm comforts of home: these define the ideal of Southern hospitality, and is a major characterizing point of our nation. People are expected to respect their neighbours and use polite terms even when addressing strangers. Some feel that this is an act put on to cover up Southern flaws such as slavery and widespread poverty, but its nature can be traced back to the traditional Christian moral influence on the Southern states before secession. Regardless, it's made a good mark on our country, and we're proud of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT187690DESC;Founded in 1871, the National Rifle Association was originally a set of shooting clubs organized to improve the marksmanship of American soldiers. After the Civil War, it was noted that few shots fired actually hit their targets, so improved drill was in order. These shooting clubs improved skill with firearms, and contributed to the military as a whole moving away from the classic style of rank and file warfare, which put focus on volume of fire rather than accuracy. Within a few decades, firearms and marksmanship became a proud part of the country's culture.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Farmers are fearing that our supply of cotton won't last with this insect terrorizing our provinces, and many are suggesting that we abandon cotton to focus on different trade goods. Should we follow their advice, or try to recover the cotton?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT188100DESC;Rising up from the south, the boll weevil is a dreadful little insect that seems to have little interest in anything but planting its eggs in cotton flowers and buds. Regardless of its origins, it poses a major threat to our cotton industry, and must be stopped at all costs. For the time being, though, we fear that there may be no direct way of containing the insect, not on a large scale.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

mexican_purchase_desc;We are still inferior to the Union, and rely on them for Pacific imports. If we can purchase the regions of Sonora and Chihuahua from Mexico, then we will be able to control a coast on the Global and Pacific oceans, greatly increasing our industrial capability.

EVT187700DESC;One hundred years ago, the Thirteen Colonies organized and succeeded in their rebellion against their British colonial oppressors, forming the United States of America on the 4th of July, 1776. We have seen this country through fire and water, but by God, we will never let America fall. Now unto the end of time, the United States will be a shining name in the pages of history, a beacon of freedom and democracy in the world. Today of all days, we truly should be proud.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT187710DESC;Travelling along the western trails into California, a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ wagon group known as the Donner party has been discovered... or, at least, what is left of it. The people of the Donner party were stranded in the wilderness for so long that their minds were lost, and they succumbed to cannibalism and other savage acts. With the revelation of this news, the world can now see the mortifying reality of life in Western America.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT187720DESC;Due to recent heavy rainfall and the negligence of a local construction company, a dam on the Little Conemaugh River has burst, flooding and decimating Johnstown, Pennsylvania. The cleanup costs will be higher than any disaster we've seen before, and more importantly, the people will soon be looking for someone to place the blame upon. The government could step in and take care of everything in place of the local industrialists and clubs that may have caused the flood, or we can require that the groups pay from their own pockets to fix their mistake.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT187730DESC;Though our war with the Confederate States is far from over, it isn't going either poorly or well. However, that doesn't stop the war from being a contentious issue, and in New York most notably the people have staged an uprising against the local government, demanding that the strict conscription practices in place for the war be rescinded. We're in the middle of a war, so we have to choose some way to deal with them, without sacrificing our draft. The question is, are these riots worth putting down, or are our other concerns far greater?;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT187750DESC;The Gulf of Mexico is no stranger to extreme wind and rain, but in 1900, a certain hurricane blew away any old records.

EVT187760DESC;A man going by the name of Doctor Howard Henry Holmes has been apprehended and executed after murdering up to two-hundred people after the last $COUNTRY_ADJ$ World's Fair. According to police reports, he built up a so-called "Murder Castle" in $CAPITAL$, killing primarily young women that he lured to his lair. Using legitimate medical contacts he was able to dispose of the bodies, and for a long time he remained far out of suspicion. Only after leaving the city due to economic troubles did Holmes end up being captured, as a result of alleged horse theft. Afterwards the truth of his grisly crimes came to light, and he was sentenced to death.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MISSFLOOD1DESC;Along the Missouri River and the Upper Mississippi, heavy rainfall and inadequate preparation have led to major floods, the worst in decades. With the increasing population of $COUNTRY$ especially in the areas around the Mississippi and its tributaries, it is becoming increasingly important to develop a set of levees and ditches to prevent high water from wiping out whole towns.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MISSFLOOD2DESC;Not long after last decade's horrendous floods along the Upper Mississippi, there has been another year of rain and subsequent floods along the very same Mississippi River. We had prepared and made sure riverside towns were prepared for any threat of flooding, but this time the floods hit mostly rural and new colonial towns, which hadn't yet managed to create systems of levees to cope with rising water levels.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MISSFLOOD3DESC;The worst floods yet have hit many of our cities, no matter how high we built the levees nor how low and long we dug the ditches. New Orleans, shining gem of Louisiana, has been dealt a heavy blow, along with cities and regions all along the mighty Mississippi River.

EVTDESC187890;There are a growing number of Freemasons within Brazilian churches, which is nominally prohibited in Catholicism - they exist most commonly within Lay Fraternities, which are generally charitable organizations chiefly associated with local churches, though technically independent in their operation. Historically, however, the church in Brazil has been an apparatus of the state, rather than being independent, thus making religious issues in Brazil matters of the state, not the Catholic Church. Local bishops have been calling for Freemason clergymen to resign, including a man named Dom Vital, who has issued an interdict against certain Lay Fraternities that have refused to have their Freemason brothers resign, preventing any sacraments from being celebrated within these Fraternity buildings. This goes against the state control of the Church, so the Lay brothers say, and is a direct challenge to government power considering that certain members of Parliament are noted Freemasons.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC187892;Dom Vidal has refused to annul his controversial interdict, and has been joined in protest by the bishop Antonio de Macedo Costa, who has recently passed a similar interdict against uncooperative Lay Fraternities. This refusal could be used as a reason to arrest and imprison the bishops, hopefully preventing them from causing more trouble in the future, and to remove them as challenges to the authority of the state.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC187894;Vidal and Costa have been imprisoned for acting against the power of the sovereign Brazilian state, causing shock and anger amongst the Catholic populace in the country. The New Prime Minister, a Freemason and a Catholic himself, has called for his own resignation in the case that amnesty is not granted to Costa and Vidal. We have little choice at this point, considering that keeping the bishops in prison would only lead to the government crumbling. It seems we've been dragged into a situation in which we cannot end things positively.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC187900;With the Civil War having swung in favour of the Confederate States, there is a growing secessionist movement in the city of New York, with locals calling for New York City to leave the Union and follow its own, independent path. With each passing day this movement gains more popularity, and this certainly will cause a problem in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC187901;The inevitable has come to pass. The city of New York has ordered a referendum amongst the people, calling for secession from the United States of America. The results, legitimate or otherwise, show that the people of New York are overwhelmingly in favour of secession, and the city's officials have made it abundantly clear that, should independence be denied, there will be another Civil War at hand.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC187902;We are at war for our freedom! This conflict will not be an easy one, but there certainly must be other countries that can aid us in achieving the independence that we need. Shall we seek them out, or face American wrath alone?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC187903;Civil war rages in America, and the people of New York City have requested that we aid them in their conflict. If we choose to do so, it may anger people within our own country who seek independence, and certainly the Americans will be less than pleased.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC187904;Diplomats from $FROMCOUNTRY$ have declared that their nation is fully in support of New York's independence, and that we can expect to see $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ military and economic aid in the times to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

declaration_independence_ny_desc;Now that we are de facto independent from the Union, we should confirm this as a constitutional truth, and set ourselves as being apart from the country we have seceded from. This way, the United States will have less of a claim on our territory, and we can exist in peace, albeit a potentially fragile one.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

claim_ny_state_desc;We currently control the city of New York, and though this is a strong hub for our new country, it is still small. Being the heart of New York state before we achieved independence, we can justify a claim to the whole of New York State, though we would not be able to remove the Union's claim on this region as we did with our capital city.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

aberdeen_act_desc;In the 1820s, the Brazilian government signed legislature to formally end the slave trade in their country, but this law is not put into force. As the primary force in the world against the evils of slavery, it falls upon us to ensure that Brazil follows international conventions and puts an end to the slave trade.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mulatto_african_tension_title;Favour the Mulattos;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mulatto_african_tension_desc;There exists in Brazil a sharp tension between Brazilian-born blacks and mulattos, and the African slaves taken from overseas. By favouring the mulattos and granting some of them manumission in direct opposition to the Africans, we can appease Brazilian-born slaves while sparking tensions between them and the African slaves, reduicng the chances that they will rebel against us.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC187914;The young Dom Pedro II, Emperor of Brazil, is yet too young to rule the country, due to his father abdicating in 1831 in order to restore his daughter Maria to her rightful throne of Portugal. Until the child Emperor is of age, the country will be looked over by parliamentary officials and a court of regents.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC187915;After much debate, it has been decided that Pedro II, though still under the age of majority, will reign without a regency. He has proven to be a very capable young man, though he is quite shy, and he is much beloved by the people. Due to the poor rulership of the regency, it will be immediately terminated, and Dom Pedro II will officially begin his reign as Emperor of Brazil.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC187916;Dom Pedro II, the Magnanimous, has passed away this morning. The people of Brazil loved him until the very end, and his impeccable rulership brought a true golden age to the Empire of Brazil. Working towards the cause of abolition and civil freedom, Dom Pedro made many influential friends, with his various associates, from Friedrich Nietzsche and Alexander Graham Bell to Victor Hugo and Charles Darwin. An intellectual and a devoted emperor, in his later years he found himself disappointed with the role of a ruler, so perhaps with his passing he has achieved the happiness that eluded him all his life.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC187917;The imperial administration of Dom Pedro II has, with the recent coup and overthrow of the government, been reduced to dust. The emperor has officially and willingly abdicated the throne, and has not tried to retake it or resist the end of the Empire. Government of the country is being transferred to a council of able governors, and the royal family of Brazil and Portugal are hereby exiled from this country for ever more.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Many were impressed by his eloquence and the intelligence in his arguments against slavery, saying that 'in a land of freedom, we celebrate the sight of a man in chains.' He could become a major force in the cause of abolitionism, and already pro-slave politicians have demanded that his speeches be censored.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE187926;Progressive Society in $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC187926;Capitalists have formed what they call a 'Progressive Society' in $PROVINCENAME$, hoping to bring an end to slavery. Their reasoning is that slavery, as a rural, plantation-based economic model, has no place in a nation attempting to industrialize and compete in the modern economy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE187930;$PROVINCENAME$ Slaves and Marx;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC187930;In the plantation fields of $PROVINCENAME$, the sound of 'The Internationale' can be heard more loudly and frequently than old slave songs. Many working slaves, having learned to read, have also learned about the philosophies of men like Karl Marx, and his vision of a world without social classes. What they intend should be obvious, considering their situation in our country.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE187935;Cheap Labour in $PROVINCENAME$!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC187935;Factories dot the landscape where once there used to be plantations and farms that ran on the blood and sweat of slaves. In this new $COUNTRY$, though, employers have begun hiring cheap workers, often immigrants, because the cost of keeping slaves has become unsustainable for many. Arguments could be made against them that they are sabotaging the economy, but in a free economy, they have the right to employ whomever they choose.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC187940;Two Confederate diplomats, hoping to establish good relations with our country, are aboard the HMS Trent. We have received urgent news lately, however, that the American USS San Jacinto has intercepted the Trent and taken the diplomats as prisoners. This can be seen as an act of war on British territory, and many are calling for an American apology and reparations for this insult.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC187942;We have received word that the British, after their HMS Trent was commandeered by a Union captain on the USS San Jacinto. The Trent is carrying two Confederate diplomats, en route to Britain and France, no doubt in order to coerce them into joining the war. The British are demanding an apology from our officials and the immediate release of the diplomats, and have been making isolated showings of force along the Canadian border.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC187943;Delegates from the United States have apologized and released the two Confederate envoys into British care. They made several demonstrations that they would not interfere with British shipping in any way in the future, and our own officials came back quite pleased with the meeting. Of course, at this point we certainly cannot join the Confederates, or offer them any support, in light of tense Anglo-American relations as a result of the Trent affair.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC187944;The United States has begun to position troops along its border with our colony in Canada, making it clear that they will not back down. Official delegates from the United States government declare that what they did was only an act of war against the Confederates, but if British diplomats press the Trent issue, then the Union will consider Britain on the side of the Confederate secessionists, and react accordingly. It seems that there is no choice now but war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC187918;In the Brazilian navy, the use of the dreaded lash to discipline soldiers has been officially banned for several years. However, many white officers still use it to keep their typically black, sometimes even ex-slave crews in line, causing accusations of institutionalized discrimination in the military. Several all-black crews have recently revolted against their officers, taken control of their ships, and are in port outside $CAPITAL$, threatening to bombard the city. They are demanding amnesty and reparations, and an end to discrimination, a promise we may not be able to completely deliver.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC187919;Though the Atlantic Slave Trade has been dismantled by the British, many traders in Brazil have found ways to smuggle slaves into our country. Here in $PROVINCENAME$, new slaves have been sold into plantations; they may improve our economy, but the British may eventually catch on if we don't put an end to this.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC187920;Near the Bagagem River, a young slave girl has found a priceless treasure: a massive diamond, certainly one of the biggest in the world.

EVTDESC187922;Due to its fertile farmland, fair weather, close access to the Pacific and abundance of natural resources- including gold -the state of California is rapidly booming in population, showing an unprecedented demographic increase due to natural increase and mass immigration!

EVTDESC187923;Being a constitutional monarch, our Emperor Dom Pedro II has quite a lot of time to travel the world and meet the many personalities therein. With his daughter Isabel at home as his regent, Dom Pedro is able to visit Egypt, Britain, Austria and France, speaking with intellectuals and even ordinary people. He always demands that he is treated as just a man, and not an emperor, and he has gained considerable fame overseas.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC187924;California's population has drastically increased over a short period of time, and while for a time this was one of the largest migrations in our country's history, it has now begun to slow to a trickle. California is still booming, but perhaps not as strongly as before.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
