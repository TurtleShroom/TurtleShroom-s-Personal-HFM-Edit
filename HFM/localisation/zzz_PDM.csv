EVTNAME16401;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Applies For Statehood!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC16401;Yesterday morning we recieved a petition from the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government, requesting Statehood in the United States of Central America. A state constitution has been submitted, along with maps defining the state's territorial boundries. Common opinion seems to hold it a forgone conclusion that we will accept this petition for statehood and forever join $FROMCOUNTRY$ into our prosperous $COUNTRY_ADJ$ republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME16500;Second Constitutional Convention;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC16500;Delegates from the northern states are growing increasingly impatient with the deadlock in the senate on the issue of slavery, citing what they see as an unreasonable balance of power currently controlled by southern interests. This has led to demands for a second constitutional convention and a change to a more proportional system of government based on population-- a demand adamantly opposed by the south, and not universally supported even in the north.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME16501;Dissatisfaction in the North;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC16501;Delegates from the northern states are growing increasingly impatient with the deadlock in the senate on the issue of slavery, citing what they see as an unreasonable balance of power currently controlled by southern interests. Despite the move to more proportional government, things have not changed and thus there is talk that perhaps it is the north that needs to secede into a new union based on the freedom of men.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC16505;Talk of secession from the Union can be heard on the streets of $PROVINCENAME$. In fact, all over $STATENAME$ there is talk of secession, fueled by outrage over the changes to the American constitution which have stripped states of their equality. Local sentiments seem to be turning towards the south even though $STATENAME$ is not a slave state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC16506;Talk of secession from the Union can be heard on the streets of $PROVINCENAME$. In fact, all over $STATENAME$ there is talk of secession, as liberals spread loud complaints over their dissatisfaction with the deadlock in the senate. They speak of a new Union based in the north, based on the true freedom the fouding fathers intended.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME16510;The Free States of America;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC16510;A convention of northern delegates have convened in Philadelphia to announce the formation of a new union: the Free States of America, free of slavery and dedicated to true freedom for all men. The 'true' American government has decreed this the act of traitors, and is considering whether a peaceful resolution through negotiation is even possible. The so-called Free American government, however, is calling on patriots to rebel against a government held hostage to southern aristocrats and hidebound thinking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME16511;Fort Mifflin Fired Upon!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC16511;While debate has been raging in $CAPITAL$ regarding whether to negotiate with the Free States, loyal American troops within Free State territory have been on the move and preparing for the worst. One battalion relocated to Fort Mifflin and proceeded to ignore Free State demands for their immediate withdrawal. Days later, Free State troops appeared and demanded the fort's surrender-- and when the commander refused, the Free State forces opened fire. This is a clear provocation. All hopes for a peaceful settlement have now ended.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME16515;The Union Sundered;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC16515;The civil war is over... and we have lost. The United States of America that was is now gone. Delegates in $CAPITAL$ have convened to urge the government to put aside the former constitution, declaring it irrelevant for the reality that now faces us. A new constitution is being drafted, one heralding our place as master of the South, though there are yet some who say our destiny must one day be retaken and that not all is lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

tanzimat_era_desc;The Tanzimat era was a period of reform in the Ottoman Empire, characterized by an increasing drive towards westernization and multiculturalism.

tanzimat_western_democracy_desc;With an indication of our alignment towards Europe and a movement away from traditional religious institutions, the Ottoman government has the opportunity to fully enact the ideals of the Young Ottomans and the Tanzimat Reforms. This will endear us towards other European powers and ensure they do not undertake any radical notions of partitioning the Balkans, even if it will ultimately upset more radical Turkish nationalists.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tanzimat_mixed_title;The Constitutional Era;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tanzimat_mixed_desc;The Kanûn-i Esâsî, or 'Basic Law', was a period of constitutional rule in the Empire promoted by the Young Ottomans and intended to serve as a compromise between conservative religious groups and those more interested in reforming the Empire into a modern European democracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tanzimat_islamic_caliphate_title;The Islamic Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tanzimat_islamic_caliphate_desc;With an orientation of the Empire towards embracing Arab cultures, and a rejection of the liberal ideals of the Tanzimat Reforms, the Empire has put itself on a path of regaining its role as the preeminent Islamic power. Traditionalists are pleased, and we have seen a widespread acceptance of our aim among Arab groups. While European nations will no doubt seek to interfere, we can at least rest easy knowing that nationalism will not find an easy hold in the Islamic Arab world.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Full rights will be granted to the Empire's minorities, and laws passed to grant each millet the right to use  the religious law of its population. This will go a long way towards dealing with some of the nationalist strife the country has suffered, and bring the Ottoman Empire into a new and multicultural age.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
